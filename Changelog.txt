    - Fixed gyro settings display when editing a process profile

    New UI
    - Added gyro sensitivity setting

Version 2.1.1
    Fixes
    - Fixed saving settings if the application is installed in Program Files

Version 2.1.0
    New UI
    - Improved for displays with very high DPI (>175%)
    - Scrollbar visibility now depends on the OS setting
    - Added localization via ini files (in the pmgui/Localization folder)

      - Left/Right shoulder buttons – switch between tabs
      - D-pad/Left stick – navigate between controls
      - A-button – select/Enter
      - B-button – back/Escape
      - Right stick – scroll window
      - Start button – collapse/expand left menu

    Gyro
    - Added option to swap X and Y axes (for Win 4)

    Fixes
    - Fixed non-working keyboard hotkeys

Version 2.0.0
    User Interface
    - Added a completely new simple user interface mode (with the most convenient settings).
      You can switch between the new and old UI.

    Power Management
    - Optimized process profile handling, reduce CPU/energy usage when any process profile is configured

    Fixes
    - Fixed gyro autostart settings
    - Remove the "Disable part of AMD Adrenaline driver after sleep" option from UI because latest AMD drivers fixed this issue.

Version 1.2.5
    Power Management
    — The "Disable Bluetooth" and "Disable Bosch BMI160 accelerometer" options are enabled by default.

    Fixes
    — Added the "Disable part of AMD Adrenaline driver after sleep" option. This fixes a system crash/restart when launching 3D games after Modern Standby (a bug in the latest available AMD drivers) by disabling "AMD External Events Utility" service. 

Version 1.2.4
    Fixes
    - Fixed a low MTP file transfer rate issue when pausing the Bosch BMI160 Accelerometer driver (conflict occurred due to MTP and Accelerometer drivers running in the same process)

Version 1.2.3
    Polling Optimizations
    - Removed obtaining the current GPU power consumption (this caused increased CPU usage and power consumption in Idle).

    Power State
    - Added possibility to reset GPU frequencies to factory values by switching to Modern Stanby instead of Hibernation.

    Fixes
    - Fixed crash on app exit after the system has been in sleep mode.

Version 1.2.2
    OSD
    - Saving RTSS "benchmark mode" in permanent settings.

Version 1.2.1
    Localization
    - Added Russian language.

    Gyro/Stick Simulation
    - Optimizations for simulate Xbox/DS4 sticks by gyro.

Version 1.2.0
    Power Management
    - Implemented the ability to suspend/throttle the Bosch BMI160 Accelerometer driver when not in use, significantly reducing CPU usage and power consumption in idle states.
    Gyro/Mouse Events
    - Fixed an issue where gyro and mouse events were incorrectly generated after the device entered sleep mode or the screen was turned off, which could lead to spurious wakeups. 

Version 1.1.1
    Polling Optimizations
    - The app no longer polls the controller every time to check if it is still connected.
    - The hardware monitoring interval has been increased.
    - The gyro poll interval has been increased.

    Gyro/Mouse Simulation
    - The gyro is no longer polled if simulation is disabled.
    - If a gyro hotkey or trigger is set, the gyro polling stops when the hotkey or trigger is not pressed.
    - The interval to check for gyro hotkey or trigger presses has been increased.

    Process Management
    - The app no longer checks running processes if there are no process profiles in the settings.

    User Interface
    - Hardware monitoring labels are no longer updated if the app is minimized.

    Power State
    - The interval to check the AC/DC power state has been increased.
    - Support for Modern Standby has been added.
    - The app can now automatically disable Bluetooth in sleep mode.

    GPU Optimization
    - The GPU parameters update interval has been increased if 'auto/float optimize GPU' is disabled.

    Hotkeys
    - The interval to check keyboard and controller hotkey presses has been increased.
    - The app no longer checks the controller or keyboard state if hotkeys are not set or are disabled.
