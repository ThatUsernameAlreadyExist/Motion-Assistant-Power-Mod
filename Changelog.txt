Version 1.2.0
    Power Management
    - Implemented the ability to suspend/throttle the Bosch BMI160 Accelerometer driver when not in use, significantly reducing CPU usage and power consumption in idle states.
    Gyro/Mouse Events
    - Fixed an issue where gyro and mouse events were incorrectly generated after the device entered sleep mode or the screen was turned off, which could lead to spurious wakeups.

    Polling Optimizations
    - The app no longer polls the controller every time to check if it is still connected.
    - The hardware monitoring interval has been increased.
    - The gyro poll interval has been increased.

    Gyro/Mouse Simulation
    - The gyro is no longer polled if simulation is disabled.
    - If a gyro hotkey or trigger is set, the gyro polling stops when the hotkey or trigger is not pressed.
